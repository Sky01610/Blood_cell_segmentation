# Blood_cell# Project Title

This project is a Python-based implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for image denoising. The GAN consists of a generator and a discriminator, both implemented using PyTorch. The generator is responsible for generating clean images from noisy inputs, while the discriminator is trained to distinguish between real clean images and the ones generated by the generator.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The project requires the following packages:

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.8+
- torchvision
- PIL
- numpy
- OpenCV
- tqdm

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
```

2. Install the required packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Training Script

To train the model, run the `train.py` script. This script will train the GAN on the dataset specified in the script and save the model parameters after each epoch.

```bash
python train.py
```

## Running the Testing Script

To test the model, run the `test.py` script. This script will load the trained model parameters and use the model to denoise the test images.

```bash
python test.py
```

## Evaluating the Model

To evaluate the model's performance, run the `correlation_PSNR.py` script. This script will calculate the PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) between the original clean images and the denoised images generated by the model.

```bash
python correlation_PSNR.py
```
